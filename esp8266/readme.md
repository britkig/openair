# OpenAir Receiver for ESP8266-powered Micro Controllers
This section of the repository contains the code for implementing the OpenAir UDP protocol on microcontrollers using a ESP8266-based control chip.

The example code is optimised for use on the ESP01S, using GPIO pins 0 and 1 for *Rehearsal* and *On Air* status respectively. You can change which pins are used by altering the `DOutput Output1` and `DOutput Output2` GPIO pin assigments.
